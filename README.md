# Password-Generator

# Installation
Download the file from github, then add it to a folder where you can open it by using VS (visual sutdio code),


# General Info
I created a random password generator, which is intended to make it easier to create a password that is difficult to crack.
There are 8 to 128 characters to choose from, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters.
The password generator will first ask you how many characters you want in your password, then you will be forced to choose other characters, which I mentioned above.
